# Learning Journal: Python Development Acellerator
## By Scott J. Schmidt

This learning journal details the daily activity from the eight week intensive learning program that I attended at Code Fellows. Each day, I'll be logging my thoughts, experiments, learnings, and other details about my time at CF and the journey that I've undertaken. 

### User Story's for Rev. 2 of the Learning Journal:
- As an author I want to have a permalink for each journal entry where I can view it in detail.
- As an author I want to edit my journal entries so I can fix errors.
- As an author I want to use MarkDown to create and edit my entries so that I can format them nicely.
- As an author I want to see colorized code samples in my journal entries so that I can more easily understand them.
